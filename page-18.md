tarry tower true warp
prepare require pourtray weary
weep power appear trap

uproar aware riot poor
rate appetite ripe pity
tear quarter paper pour

root apart pipe quiet
poorer equity wert proprietary
your outer wrap pure

wear prey piety part
retire pair wrote prayer
ware potter warrior eater

orator quite await wait
quit tire report terror
away rear tare roar

property requite repay attire
repair upper utter water
array purer pray tree

trow reap troop rare
write pare proper year
error arrow porter repairer

wipe party were wept
